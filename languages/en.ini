Of course, I could easily record my workouts with my running watch, but then the cadence and power (in watts) the ergometer measures would be lost. In order to be able to use this data as well, I have written a small converter, which I put online here. The training files from the USB stick are converted into TCX files that can be uploaded to Strava."

Strava then calculates the calorie consumption from the power data by itself (see: <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216917097-Calorie-Calculation'> Calorie Calculation </a>)."
